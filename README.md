# MerkleTree Implementation Python

### Running Locally

To see a list of available commands, run `make help`

To run the program:

1. You need (any) file of sufficient size, in the root of the project named **data.txt**.
2. You can create a command using `make create-file`, although it is painfully slow in python.
3. Run `make run` to run the program.

> Note: All hash values, for membership proofs, are hard-coded inside _data.py_
